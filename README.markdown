## Installation

### Using Sublime Package Control

If you are using Will Bond's excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install the Table Cleaner package via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item.

### Using Git

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the package and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area.

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the package repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/mishu91/Sublime-Text-2-Table-Cleaner "Table Cleaner"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option

* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory
